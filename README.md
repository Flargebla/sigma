## Overview

S.I.G.M.A is a web app developed in Rails that allows users to upload and connect images between other members of the community!

In our exciting project, a person can log in and provide information regarding their personal character. 
Once a user is logged in, they can begin uploading images, memes, and even **GIFS**! Over time and with more users, the web will grow and become as more users like more pictures, the web will tryly show how complex and connected the community really is!
